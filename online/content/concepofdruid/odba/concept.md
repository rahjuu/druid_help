ODBA is short for Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration. It is a new acceleration index which quantifies the three-dimensional movement of animals as the value of acceleration and is assumed to be a proxy for activity-specific measurment and has been used in the field of wild animal ecology.

In Druid Technology, we use a built-in 3-axis accelerometer to collect the acceleration data at the frequency of 25 Hz. Every 10 minutes or 30 minutes, DEBUT devices calculate ODBA value using the collected acceleration data. The ODBA value can be used as an index to describe the activity status of the animal.
